## Switch SMF Recording to Log Stream

This is the short explanation of my practice. 

### Overview

I have a small z/OS system that has no CICS, DB2, IMS, MQ or any ISV products. My target is to switch SMF recording from data set to DASD-only log stream. So, we have to create new PARMLIB member. We should decide name of the log streams, record types that we want to record, SMF parameters, SMF exits and etc for new member. A user catalog and an alias points to that catalog is needed just for the log streams. Also, log streams requires to be SMS-managed. Then, policies can be defined while creating log streams using IXCMIAPU utility. Our log streams are ready to switch, after create log stream staging data sets and define policies.

### Prerequisites

There are two prerequisites so that in your system you can perform this practice. These are:

- Couple data sets have already defined in the system.
- SMS have to be installed and activated. System logger requires that.
- You should be able to initiliaze SMS-managed volume or convert non-SMS volume to SMS-managed.

### Phases

#### 1- Create New PARMLIB Member

Previously, I have been using MAN data sets in my system to record SMF records.

Firstly, new member must be created in the PARMLIB. I named this new member 'SMFPRMLS' (SMFPRMxx). Key thing in this member is to code 'RECORDING(LOGSTREAM)'. Then, I put 2 log streams. One of these is default log stream that records all of the SMF records and other is to keep records that records just SMF records for SCRT report.

Other parameters (record types, exits, interval parameters and etc.) nearly same with my old SMFPRM member. You can obtain two of these members in this repository. You can go to [IBM Knowledge Center](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSLTBW_2.1.0/com.ibm.zos.v2r1.ieae200/smfparm.htm) to get further information for the SMFPRMxx parameters.

#### 2- Create Couple Data Sets

I already have couple datasets in my system, so I don't do anything for this step. But, I put here my sample JCL to create couple datasets. (Don't forget to code couple data sets in COUPLExx member.)

    //DCDSLOGR JOB (SPG1,1),'DEFINE CDS',CLASS=A,MSGLEVEL=(1,1),MSGCLASS=X,  
    // NOTIFY=&SYSUID,REGION=0M

    //STEP10   EXEC PGM=IXCL1DSU

    //SYSIN    DD   *                                                        
         DEFINEDS SYSPLEX(VBTPLEX)

                  CATALOG STORCLAS(SCNONSMS)                                 
              DATA TYPE(LOGR)                                                
                  ITEM NAME(LSR) NUMBER(2000)                               
                  ITEM NAME(LSTRR) NUMBER(10)                               
                  ITEM NAME(DSEXTENT) NUMBER(10)                            
                  ITEM NAME(SMDUPLEX) NUMBER(1)                             
         DEFINEDS SYSPLEX(VBTPLEX)                                            
                  DSN(SYS1.VBT1.LOGR.CDS02) VOLSER(CPL002)                 
                  CATALOG STORCLAS(SCNONSMS)                                 
              DATA TYPE(LOGR)                                                
                  ITEM NAME(LSR) NUMBER(2000)                 
                  ITEM NAME(LSTRR) NUMBER(10)                 
                  ITEM NAME(DSEXTENT) NUMBER(10)              
                  ITEM NAME(SMDUPLEX) NUMBER(1)
    
#### 3- Prepare DFSMS

SMS manages the DASD log data sets and staging data sets, because system logger uses SMS to allocate data sets, such as the DASD log stream and staging data sets. 

Therefore, a storage group and a storage class for log streams are supposed to be created and ACS routines need to be updated so that right classes assign to log streams. Then, SCDS have to be translated, validated and activated. (I am not going to cover in detail these subjects in this practice.)

![Screenshot](https://github.com/ozgurhepsag/Basic-z-OS-Utilities-and-Practices/blob/main/Switch%20SMF%20Recording%20to%20Log%20Stream/Images/storclas.png)

IXGLOGR is the default HLQ for all of the log streams.

![Screenshot](https://github.com/ozgurhepsag/Basic-z-OS-Utilities-and-Practices/blob/main/Switch%20SMF%20Recording%20to%20Log%20Stream/Images/storgrp.png)

After SCLOGR storage class and SGLOGR storage group was created for the log streams, SMS-managed volume could be initiliazed with 'STGR' parameter of INIT command of ICKDSF utility or non-SMS volume could be converted to SMS-managed by 'CONVERTV' command of DFDSS. In this practice, LOGR01 volume has been used.

#### 4- Create User Catalog and Alias for Log Stream

IBM recommends that you plan your high level qualifier carefully and add an alias for each high level qualifier in the master catalog that points to a user catalog. So, an alias named 'IXGLOGR' and a user catalog in the LOGR01 volume should be defined.

        BUFNI(4) )                                                       
    /*

#### 5- Define Log Streams and Policies

I defined two log streams that names is the same with the ones in the SMFPRMLS member except HLQ. For an SMF log stream, the first 7 characters must be 'IFASMF.'. You can see below my JCL for this step.

    //DEFLOGR  JOB  (),'OZGUR',CLASS=A,MSGCLASS=H,REGION=0M,        
    //   NOTIFY=&SYSUID,MSGLEVEL=(1,1)                              
    //DEFINELS EXEC PGM=IXCMIAPU                                    
    //SYSPRINT DD   SYSOUT=*                                        
    //SYSABEND DD   SYSOUT=*                                        
    //SYSIN    DD   *                                               
        DATA TYPE(LOGR) REPORT(YES)                                
        DEFINE LOGSTREAM NAME(IFASMF.VBT1.SCRT)                    
            DESCRIPTION(SYS_SCRT_RECORDS)                          
            DASDONLY(YES)                                          
            STG_SIZE(2000)                                         
            LS_SIZE(10000)                                         
            AUTODELETE(YES)                                        
            RETPD(180)                                             
        DEFINE LOGSTREAM NAME(IFASMF.VBT1.DEFAULT)                 
            DESCRIPTION(SYSTEM_OTHER_REC)                          
            DASDONLY(YES)                                          
            STG_SIZE(50000)                                        
            LS_SIZE(250000)                                        
            AUTODELETE(YES)        
            RETPD(60)              
    
Because I want to use DASD-only log stream, DASDONLY(YES) parameter should not be forgotten.

There are many parameter to define log stream. Here is the description of the parameters that I use: <br> <br>
**NAME:** Name of the log stream <br>
**DASDONLY:** Type of log stream <br>
**RETPD:** Number of days that the system logger retains messages before it deletes them <br>
**AUTODELETE:** Automatic delete option <br>
**LG_SIZE:** Size, in 4 KB blocks, of the offload data sets for the log stream <br>
**STG_SIZE:** Size, in 4 KB blocks, of the staging data sets for the log stream <br>

After log stream defined, you can see that log streams are ready to use. 

    D LOOGER,L

You can observe that staging data sets have been created in LOGR01 volume, even if log streams are not being in use.

#### 6- Switch SMF PARMLIB Member

Now, we can use the our new PARMLIB member (SMFPRMLS) after enter 'SET SMF=LS' command from SDSF or console.

Here is some output of the console commands related to log streams after switch:

#### 7- Update IEASYSxx

In IEASYSxx (IEASYS00 in my system) member's SMF parameter should be updated like 'SMF=LS', if we want to use log streams after IPLs.

![Screenshot](https://github.com/ozgurhepsag/Basic-z-OS-Utilities-and-Practices/blob/main/Switch%20SMF%20Recording%20to%20Log%20Stream/Images/IEASYS.png)

Do not delete your old MAN data sets and SMF PARMLIB member that used to recording SMF records to data sets. Because, you can switch recording types via 'SET SMF=LS' (SMFPRMLS for log stream recording) or 'SET SMF=DS' (SMFPRMDS for data set recording) operator commands.
